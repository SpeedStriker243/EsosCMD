# EsosCMD
A command-line application written in Python. It's just a simple command processor behind the scenes, but it feels a lot like an OS.

## What's new with version 0.2-prerelease
- This segment! Figured I should.
- EsosScript support.
- The EsosFunctions file has more purpose now!
- For Windows computers, EsosCMD will now automatically disable the prompt colours. *nix systems automatically have the colour on.

## Tasks
### Achieved
- Create a command processor
- Keep functions in a separate file
- Allow for commands with arguments
### In progress
- Create a function that loads an EsosCMD program and runs it
- Create a scripting language that allows for creation of EsosCMD programs
### To do
- Include commands that give you the versatility of a full terminal emulation package

## Q&A
### What does the name mean?
The name is a play on the words 'esoteric' and 'OS'.

### Why Python?
I'm way more comfortable in it.

### Isn't this just SSUTIL 2.0?
Effectively, yeah -- EsosCMD is a continuation of the original idea for SpeedStriker Utility, but without relying on an underlying terminal.

### How do I run it?
Run `kernel.py` with Python 3.6 or later.

### Any releases?
When version 1.0 gets finished... and also when I find out how to deploy Python apps to computers without Python.
