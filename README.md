# EsosCMD
Feels like an OS, behaves like a terminal.

## What does the name mean?
The name is a play on the words 'esoteric' and 'OS'.

## Why Python?
I'm way more comfortable in it.

## Isn't this just SSUTIL 2.0?
Effectively, yeah -- EsosCMD is a continuation of the original idea for SpeedStriker Utility, but without relying on an underlying terminal.

## How do I run it?
Run `kernel.py` with Python 3.6 or later.
